## General tech notes for working with potentially troublesome computer hardware
### Specific computer model details
  Acer Swift 3 SF313-52-78W6
    Note : If I had known this computer was going to be so annoying I would've just bought a Lenovo, steer clear of this machine if you want to avoid undue headaches and bad manufacturer practices.
    Release Date : December 04, 2020
    Intel Core i7-1065G7 1.3GHz
    16GiB RAM
    512GB SSD
    WIndows 10 Home
    Resolution : 2256 x 1504

### Failed attempt details
  All combinations of BIOS options either result in..
    1. System cannot find any USB bootable devices
    2. System loads forever, stuck on ACER screen
    3. Finally got USB to boot and run Clonezilla, was at the option selecting where to backup the image, and clonezilla was unable to find a disk to clone.
      "Error! No existing disk(s) or no unmounted disk(s) are found! To use Clonezilla to save or clone a disk, the source disk must exist or be unmounted! If you are sure the disk exists in this machine, maybe the kernel is too old? Press "Enter" to exit..."


### Stuff to try next
  Arbitrarily try more hard drives formatted to GPT, all of the guides say what I am doing should work

### BIOS
#### Hidden Shortcuts (Why is there even such a thing as a hidden shortcut..?)
  Ctrl + S : Reveal hidden option
  F2 or Del on boot to enter the BIOS

### General leads & possible tips from various searches..

### Clonezilla Event Log

1. First it wouldn't detect any bootable devices, except "Linpus Lite" which is apparently some Acer Linux thing?
  Note : BIOS options Optane for these attempts :
    Optain with RAID
    Secure Boot Off
    Intel VTX On
    Intel VTD On
  Downloaded every version of the clonezilla boot USB out of desparation
    i386, i386-pae, amd
  AMD never shows up as a bootable device, always called Linpus Lite
  i386 and i386-pae show up as bootable devices then freeze as soon as the first menu option is selected
