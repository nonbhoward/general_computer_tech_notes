## General tech notes for working with potentially troublesome computer hardware
### Specific computer model details
  Acer Swift 3 SF313-52-78W6
    Note : If I had known this computer was going to be so annoying I would've just bought a Lenovo, steer clear of this machine if you want to avoid undue headaches and bad manufacturer practices.
    Release Date : December 04, 2020
    Intel Core i7-1065G7 1.3GHz
    16GiB RAM
    512GB SSD
    WIndows 10 Home
    Resolution : 2256 x 1504
    
### Details of successful clonezilla run
  1. Always have multiple thumb drives available.. I've been surprised by a bad thumb drive before so.. first and foremost, this
  2. On this computer, the AMD image worked fine, as of writing this the versions available were
    alternative-stable 20201102-groovy
    stable 2.7.0-10
  3. Use Rufus to create the Clonezilla image (AMD version), GPT, UEFI, in ISO mode
  4. Boot to the BIOS, press Ctrl+S to unlock the option to change from Optane with RAID to AHCI (if AHCI is not selected, Clonezilla couldn't find a disk)
  5. I also disabled secure boot, disabled fast boot, and I left VTX and VTD on
  6. No further comments at this time

### Failed attempt details
  All combinations of BIOS options either result in..
    1. System cannot find any USB bootable devices
    2. System loads forever, stuck on ACER screen
    3. Finally got USB to boot and run Clonezilla, was at the option selecting where to backup the image, and clonezilla was unable to find a disk to clone.
      "Error! No existing disk(s) or no unmounted disk(s) are found! To use Clonezilla to save or clone a disk, the source disk must exist or be unmounted! If you are sure the disk exists in this machine, maybe the kernel is too old? Press "Enter" to exit..."
        Theory to fix this.. change boot mode from Optain RAID to AHCI and attempt to create disk.


### Stuff to try next
  Arbitrarily try more hard drives formatted to GPT, all of the guides say what I am doing should work

### BIOS
#### Hidden Shortcuts (Why is there even such a thing as a hidden shortcut..?)
  Ctrl + S : Reveal hidden option
  F2 or Del on boot to enter the BIOS

### Clonezilla Event Log

1. First it wouldn't detect any bootable devices, except "Linpus Lite" which is apparently some Acer Linux thing?
  Note : BIOS options Optane for these attempts :
    Optain with RAID
    Secure Boot Off
    Intel VTX On
    Intel VTD On
  Downloaded every version of the clonezilla boot USB out of desparation
    i386, i386-pae, amd
  AMD never shows up as a bootable device, always called Linpus Lite
  i386 and i386-pae show up as bootable devices then freeze as soon as the first menu option is selected
